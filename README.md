# frame-node-metadata-example

This is a simple nodejs example that demonstrates how to set and retrieve custom `metadata` when generating a _Secure Anonymous Token_ (SAT).

This example uses [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for fetching endpoints.

## Running this script

1. Install axios with `npm i axios`
2. Edit index.js to supply your [Frame API credentials](https://docs.frame.nutanix.com/frame-apis/auth/auth-with-sat.html) and Secure Anonymous Token provider endpoint URL.
3. Run the script with `node index.js`. You should see a token and the specified metadata logged to the console.
